sudo bash -c "echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space"

This command is useful for controlling environment size when running perf stat.
The env size is 3200 + 3 (X, =, \0), plus whatever is added by perf. Variables
added by perf includes PWD and PATH, about 170 B total for test config.

Should be exactly the same behavior as starting with process.Popen(env={..}).



lars@Berlin:~/bias-paper/code/env-alias$ env -i X=`head -c 3200 </dev/zero | tr '\0' '0'` perf stat -e cycles:u,r0107:u ./analysis
7fffffffe03c 7fffffffe038 

 Performance counter stats for './analysis':

            835549 cycles:u                  #    0.000 GHz
